# Customer_Trsanction_ML_Model
In this challenge, Santander invites Kagglers to help them identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted. The data provided for this competition has the same structure as the real data we have available to solve this problem. The data is anonymous, each row containing 200 numerical values identified just with a number. We will explore the data, prepare it for a model, train a model and predict the target value for the test set, then prepare a submission.
